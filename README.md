Protect content behind a paywall where a user pays by the second to
read. Content is presented in a format similar to speed reading, in
small chunks at a time. This not only protects your content but also
gives the user an opportunity to train their eye to read faster!

Anyone can launch a lightning reader of their own using [Zeit's Now toolkit](https://zeit.co/now). Just install the cli and run `now` in the project directory.

TODO: Add instructions for setting environment variables.
