# The Prism Reader

The Prism Reader is an application powered by Blockstack, Lightning, and Bitcoin. Try it live on testnet!

This is a fork of the Lightning Reader project, building on top of the work originally done there,
while changing some of the functionality for more flexibility and user control.

Protect content behind a paywall where a user pays by the second to
read. Content is presented in a format similar to speed reading, in
small chunks at a time. This not only protects your content but also
gives the user an opportunity to train their eye to read faster!

Anyone can launch a lightning reader of their own using [Zeit's Now toolkit](https://zeit.co/now). Just install the cli and run `now` in the project directory.

TODO: Add instructions for setting environment variables.
